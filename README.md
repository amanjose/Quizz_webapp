coding web-app with compiler and testcases
CodeHunt was a unique event that combined a coding competition with a treasure hunt concept.The platform we created utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver an immersive and interactive experience for participants. CodeHunt supported coding languages such as Python, Java, and C, allowing participants to choose their preferred language for the competition.

To enhance the experience, we integrated a compiler API into the platform. Once participants submitted their code, our system would automatically run a series of predefined sample test cases. If their code successfully passed all the test cases, a prompt would reveal clues for the treasure hunt. This added an exciting twist to the traditional coding competition.The event had a time limit, and once the allocated time was reached, the platform would be closed, preventing further access. This ensured fairness and allowed for the timely conclusion of the event.

CodeHunt was well-received by participants, as it combined the thrill of coding with the excitement of a treasure hunt. It provided an opportunity for participants to showcase their programming skills and problem-solving abilities while engaging in a fun and challenging environment.
